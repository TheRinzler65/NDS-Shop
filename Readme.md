# NDS-Shop

## IMPORTANT !

This is the official homebrew application of [Universal Updater](https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater). I am currently examining their code to better understand how to create my own homebrew application while adhering to the [GPLv3](https://github.com/TheRinzler65/NDS-Shop/blob/main/LICENSE) that governs this code. My application will differ in several aspects, including the user interface, icons, etc. However, I plan to retain the store system based on JSON files, which means my application will be partially inspired by their work.

**I want to clarify that I have no intention of appropriating their content. I have deep respect for their work and encourage you to do the same. If you use or modify their code, it is essential to:**

- **Retain the specified legal notices and author attributions in the code or associated documentation.**
- **Clearly indicate any modifications made to the code compared to the original version.**
- **Avoid misleading representations regarding the origin of the modified code, maintaining transparency about the original contributions.**

Thank you for adhering to these conditions to ensure ethical and GPLv3-compliant use.
